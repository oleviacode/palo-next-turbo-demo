# Next.js + Turbopack App Directory Playground

[Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) is a new incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust by the creators of Webpack and Next.js at [Vercel](https://vercel.com). On large applications Turbopack updates 10x faster than Vite and 700x faster than Webpack ([benchmark](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/benchmarks)). For the biggest applications the difference grows even more stark with updates up to 20x faster than Vite.

This playground is a mirror of the [Next.js v13 App Directory Playground](https://github.com/vercel/app-playground), but uses Turbopack as the Next.js development server (`next dev --turbo`).

**As a reminder, Turbopack is currently in beta and not yet ready for production. We appreciate your ongoing support as we work to make it ready for everyone.**

## Running Locally

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Start the dev server: `yarn dev`

## Running Storybook

1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Start the dev server: `yarn storybook`

**Note:** The playground uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) via [PostCSS](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/features/css#postcss).

# Issues

## Turbopack

Triggering `notFound()` will cause the browser to make requests to the browser non-stop during dev mode. This is a known issue in the community but not yet addressed officially. https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/50429

## API

Throughout this repo, you will see that `/app` will be used as the API to store, produce and fetch data. This is for demo purposes and unlikely to reflect real use-cases.

Pre-rendering static pages that depend on Next APIs will not work properly during prod mode. This is because the APIs are not hosted yet by the time Next is rendering the static pages, therefore unable to resolve the fetch by the time it is rendering.

Read more on [static and dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/static-and-dynamic-rendering)

```typescript
// page.tsx

async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/data/');
  // await fetch('/api/data/posts') will not work also

  return res.json();
}

export default async function Page() {
  const res: { allPosts: Post[] } = await getData();

  const posts = res.allPosts;

  return (
    <>
      <PostList posts={posts} />
    </>
  );
}

// The above will not render the data
```

You do not see this problem in dev mode because pages are pre-rendered twice.

## Cache behavior

Next stores caches inside `.next`. Failing to clear cache may produce inconsistent behavior especially when running `yarn run build && yarn run start`. Manually removing the `.next` folder is recommended to clear the cache.
